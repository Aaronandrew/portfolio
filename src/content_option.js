    aboutme: "Embarking on my academic journey at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCAT), I've passionately explored entrepreneurship, fostered innovation, and delved into the intricate relationship between humans and everyday technology. This journey has sculpted my skills, guiding me towards becoming a versatile professional in the realm of computer science and technology. My academic evolution began with a transition from mechanical to computer engineering at NCAT, where hackathons and engineering challenges affirmed my passion for computer science. As my interests shifted toward UI/UX design, courses like Game Design, Software Engineering & Design, and Information Security played a pivotal role in shaping my technical prowess and nurturing a keen eye for crafting secure and user-friendly applications. In 2019, my journey into research and entrepreneurship commenced with the initiation of website development for clients, leading to the establishment of Techpressers. This coding team, with expertise in cybersecurity, network engineering, and front-end design, marked my initial venture into a business-to-business structure, setting the stage for future endeavors.",
